# Collatz Conjecture Visualization - Tree

â€‹Customizable visualization of the Collatz conjecture in JavaScript.
Running live on the web at: https://lelserslasers.itch.io/collatz-conjecture-2

The visualization follows the Collatz rules while iterating through the sequence. If the current step is twice the value of the next step, a fixed amount of rotation is applied clockwise. Conversely, if the current step is not twice the value of the next step, half of the fixed amount of rotation is applied anticlockwise. The process continues until the value reaches 1, at which point it stops.

The outcome of this algorithm is a collection of threads that resemble an organic entity. The threads appear messy and seemingly randomized, yet they adhere to certain constraints similar to those found in nature. The visualization captures the beauty and complexity of the Collatz sequences in a visually appealing manner.
